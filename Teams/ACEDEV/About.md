<H1>About Me</H1>
<p>Hello, we are acedev. A solo team of web developers.
I have been coding for the last six years and professionally for four years. 
I would like to participate in this hackathon to do something creative and interact with developers from around the world.
I am proficient with HTML 5/CSS, C#, .NET and javascript. <br><br> <a href="ng.linkedin.com/pub/david-edokpayi/36/635/b8b/">LinkedIn</a></p>
